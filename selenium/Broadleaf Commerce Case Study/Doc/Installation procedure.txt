INSTALLATION PROCEDURE --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Install HSQL in any directory e.g. ~/HSQL

- Install Maven (current version was faulty - an older version: 325 works)
  wget http://apache.arvixe.com/maven/maven-3/3.2.5/binaries/apache-maven-3.2.5-bin.tar.gz
  tar -zxf apache-maven-3.2.5-bin.tar.gz
  sudo cp -R apache-maven-3.2.5 /usr/local
  sudo ln -s /usr/local/apache-maven-3.2.5/bin/mvn /usr/bin/mvn
  mvn -versionÂ 

- Add Maven setings and path to ~/.profile file
  export M2_HOME=/usr/local/apache-maven-3.2.5
  export M2=$M2_HOME/bin
  export PATH=$M2:$PATH

- Start HSQL Server:
  cd ~/HSQL/hsqldb-2.3.3/hsqldb/lib
  java -cp hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.server.Server --database.0 /home/marekq/EclipseForSelenium/workspace/eclipse-workspace/DemoSite/site/data/broadleaf --dbname.0 broadleaf

- Run SQL Manager: 
  cd ~/HSQL/hsqldb-2.3.3/hsqldb/lib 
  java -cp hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManagerSwing 

  Connection properties in Connect dialog: 
	Type: HSQL Database Engine Server
	Driver: org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
	URL: jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/broadleaf
	User: SA
	Password: (empty)

- Install Eclipse and ecFeed plugin.

- Install Broadleaf Commerce site according to the tutorial (downloaded from git repository): ecfeed.samples/selenium/Broadleaf Commerce Case Study/Doc/Broadleaf - Getting Started.odt. 
  As DemoSite zip use: ecfeed.samples/selenium/Broadleaf Commerce Case Study/DemoSiteWorkspace/DemoSite-4.0.5-GA-eclipse-workspace.zip
  There are some errors after loading the DemoSite project - use Automatic Quick fix to correct them. There are also many warnings.
  Set maven.home w DemoSite/build.properties as: maven.home=/usr/local/apache-maven-3.2.5

- Start Broadleaf application:
  - Package Explorer > MavenParents > DemoSite > Run as > Maven install
  - Ant script viewer (should be on the right side of Eclipse) > site > double click tomcat (this initiates SQL database)

- When all is installed and ready: 
  paste the address http://localhost:8080/ in Mozzilla Firefox. A Heat Clinic website should be visible.

- Check that the website uses HSQL as database:
  - Register any user in the site.
  - In the SQL Window paste: SELECT * FROM "PUBLIC"."BLC_CUSTOMER" click Execute SQL button. One user record with previously registered login and password should be visible.

- From git load ExternalTestsProject. Configure BuildPath to add ecfeed.jar with the same version as ecFeed plugin which was previously installed. 
  It may be necessary to correct some test source files to match the installed version of ecfeed.jar.

- Run tests from ecFeed. Remarks:
  - Before running the test, database must be in its initial state (empty). 
  - It is not recommended to cancel a running test under debugger because the database would not be cleaned then.

To restart the site after shutdown:
- Start HSQL Server.
- Start Broadleaf application (as described above).
